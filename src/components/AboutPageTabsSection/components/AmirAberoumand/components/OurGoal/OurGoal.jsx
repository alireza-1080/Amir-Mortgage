          Before Lendgo, comparing home loans meant you had to go door-to-door to local lenders, answering the same questions everywhere, filling out the same tiresome paperwork. You might find a good rate only to learn that, for whatever reason, the lender isnâ€™t interested. Our job is to handle the pesky banks so you don't have to.
